<p>The recipes in this book are English, French, Portuguese and Dutch;
while some of the best come from America, which is the true land of
cakes. All are good: the best I have starred.</p>

<p>Amateur cooks should know that for cakes to be successful it is almost
imperative that they are made and baked by the same person. Delegation
too often means ruin, the bond of sympathy between maker and baker
being only in very rare instances sufficiently close to defeat the imp
of mischief that lurks in every oven.</p>

<p>Lastly, I might say that the eggs cannot be too fresh, nor the butter
too pure; and molasses is better than treacle.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="General_Directions_for_Cake-Making">General Directions for Cake-Making</h2>
</div>


<p><i>Utensils.</i>—Use earthenware bowls and wooden spoons for mixing.</p>

<p>Several sets of tins are necessary if cake is to be made often. One
or two ordinary round tins, a tin with a hollow tube in the centre,
square tins, and shallow round tins about 8 inches in diameter for jam
sandwich and layer cakes, should be kept. A small dripping-pan is very
good to bake gingerbread in, and for very light cakes the German tin
with a loose bottom should be used. These tins are excellent, for the
bottom can be pushed up, away from the sides, and there is no danger of
the cake being broken in taking it out of the tin. They can be bought
at Harrod’s Stores, Brompton Road.</p>


<p><i>Measuring.</i>—Flour, sugar, salt, ground spices, soda, must always
be sifted before measuring. This is of the utmost importance in making
good cakes.</p>

<p>A cup is a breakfast-cup holding half a pint. The spoons are the silver
ones in general use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>A spoonful of dry material is one in which the convexity at the top
corresponds to the concavity of the spoon. A scant spoonful should be
made level with the edges of the spoon.</p>

<p>In measuring half a tea-spoon of dry material, fill it first, and then
divide it with a knife long-ways down the spoon.</p>

<p>A “heaping cupful” is a cup filled as full as it will hold. A “cupful”
should be levelled. A “scant cupful” should not be filled above about
quarter of an inch from the top.</p>

<p>It is necessary to remember in measuring half or quarter cups that a
cup is smaller at the bottom than the top. It is more satisfactory
measuring to have half-pint measures marked into quarters.</p>


<h3><i>Table of Measures</i></h3>

<p class="center">
  4 cups flour = 1 quart or 1 <abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr><br />
  2 cups of butter (solid) = 1 <abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr><br />
  2¹⁄₂ cups powdered sugar = 1 <abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr><br />
  1 cup = ¹⁄₂ pint<br />
  1 glass = ¹⁄₂ pint<br />
  1 pint milk or water = 1 <abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr><br />
  9 large eggs = 1 <abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr><br />
  1 table-spoon butter = 1 <abbr title="ounces">oz.</abbr><br />
  1 heaping table-spoon butter = 2 <abbr title="ounces">ozs.</abbr><br />
  Butter the size of an egg = 2 <abbr title="ounces">ozs.</abbr><br />
</p>


<p><i>Baking Powder.</i>—Baking powder can be used in the making of most
cakes. In some however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span> the proportion of carbonate of soda and cream
of tartar of which it consists is not right, in which case the two
ingredients should be used separately according to the directions.
Almost invariably soda should be mixed with milk or water, which should
then be strained in order to keep back any dregs. Cream of tartar
should be mixed with the flour, which should then be sifted. Both cream
of tartar and soda should be pulverized before they are measured or
used.</p>

<p>Baking powder can be bought, or made as follows:—</p>

<p class="center">
  1 part carbonate of soda<br />
  2 parts cream of tartar<br />
</p>

<p>It should be kept in an air-tight tin.</p>

<p>In nearly all cases baking powder is best mixed with the flour, which
should then be sifted through a fine sieve.</p>


<p><i>To clean currants.</i>—Sprinkle the currants with flour, put them
on a coarse sieve and rub them until the stems and grit are separated
and go through the sieve. Then wash thoroughly in water, changing
it until clear. Drain on a towel and pick over. Dry, if the weather
permits, in the <em>sun</em>, not in an oven.</p>


<p><i>To stone raisins.</i>—Pour boiling water over the raisins, and let
them stand in it for ten minutes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span> Drain and rub each raisin between
finger and thumb till the seeds come out. Cut open or chop.</p>


<p><i>Sultanas.</i>—Pick over sultanas carefully, removing the little
stems.</p>


<p><i>To blanch almonds.</i>—Put the almonds into boiling water and let
them soak in it until the skins rub off easily between the finger and
thumb. Drain and spread out to dry.</p>


<p><i>To pound almonds.</i>—After blanching let them soak for an hour in
cold water, then pound in a good sized mortar until reduced to a soft
pulp. Whilst pounding add a few drops of orange-flower water or lemon
juice.</p>


<p><i>Mixing.</i>—There are three ways of mixing. Stirring, Beating,
Cutting (or Folding).</p>


<p><i>To stir.</i>—Let the spoon touch the bottom and sides of the basin
and move it round quickly in circles of various sizes. Do not lift it
out of the mixture, and work well against the sides.</p>


<p><i>To beat.</i>—Tip the bowl to one side. Bring the spoon or fork
quickly down into the mixture and through it, take it out the other
side and bring it over and down again, scraping the sides well each
time it goes in.</p>

<p>It is important to keep the bowl of the spoon well scraped out during
mixing.</p>

<p>Beat quickly and hard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>


<p><i>To cut or fold.</i>—Turn over the mixture with a spoon and lift it
up, folding in the white of egg as lightly as possible. Do not stir or
beat but mix very gently until quite blended.</p>


<p><i>To beat eggs.</i>—It is generally best to beat the yolks and whites
separately. For beating them there is nothing better than a Dover egg
beater, although a fork can be used for the yolks and a steel knife for
the whites.</p>

<p>Beat the yolks in a bowl until they thicken and become light and creamy.</p>

<p>Beat the whites on a platter until they are stiff and absolutely dry.</p>


<p><i>To beat butter.</i>—In beating butter to a cream, if very hard it
can be slightly warmed in the oven or put into a hot bowl, but it must
on no account be melted. It should just be softened in order to make it
more easy to beat it.</p>


<p><i>To grease and fill tins.</i>—Tins can be greased with <em>fresh</em>
butter, lard or sweet oil. Sides and bottom should be evenly but not
thickly smeared with grease.</p>

<p>When a tin is to be lined with paper, cut a piece to fit the bottom
exactly, another piece to go right round the sides. This piece should
project two or three inches above the top of the tin.</p>

<p>Grease the papers thoroughly before putting them in the tin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>Fill the tins two-thirds full, leaving a very slight depression in the
centre if a flat cake is wanted, as the tendency is to rise in the
middle.</p>


<p><i>The oven.</i>—Nearly all cakes should be baked in a moderate oven,
and the fire should be so made up before putting a cake in the oven,
that it will not have to be touched again until the cake is taken
out. If this is impossible, owing to the length of time it takes, add
a little coal frequently to the fire instead of letting it down and
making it up with a great deal of fuel.</p>

<p>In baking in a gas stove, it is important that there should be no
draughts from window or door.</p>

<p>Set the cake in the middle of the oven and do not move it until it has
risen its full height, which will take about half the time in which it
is baked. For the first quarter of an hour it is not necessary to look
at the cake unless there is a fear that the oven is too hot. Afterwards
do so occasionally, opening and shutting the oven door very gently and
never taking the cake out. After it has fully risen, the cake can be
turned round if it is baking quicker on one side than the other.</p>

<p>Do not have anything else in the oven while baking a cake.</p>

<p>For layer cakes and thin cakes make up a larger fire. They should bake
quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>To test whether a cake is done, put a clean straw or skewer into the
thickest part of it. If it comes out clean the cake is done.</p>


<p><i>To remove cakes from tins.</i>—With a few exceptions cakes should
be taken out of their tins directly they come out of the oven. Turn the
tin upside down, and, if necessary, loosen the sides with a knife. Set
on a sieve to cool.</p>


<p>To all cake mixtures add a little salt, sifting it with the flour in
the proportion of a small salt-spoon of salt to every half-pint of
flour.</p>

<p>Keep flour and sugar in a dry place, or dry thoroughly before using.</p>

<h3>General Directions</h3>

<p>In making sponge cakes, beat the yolks till creamy and thick. Add the
sugar gradually, beating all the time. Add the flavouring. Beat the
whites until perfectly dry and very stiff. Stir them lightly in. Sift
in the flour and mix as lightly as possible. Do not beat after the
flour is added. Line the tins with greased paper and bake at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>


<h3>*American Sponge Cake</h3>

<p class="recipe">

  1 gill cold water
</p>

<p>Break the eggs in a basin leaving out the whites of two. Add to the
eggs the lemon peel and juice. Boil the sugar and water together until
clear. Pour the syrup gently over the unbeaten eggs, and beat quickly
and well for fifteen minutes. Sift the flour three times and stir it
lightly into the mixture. Bake in square flat tins. Use the whites to
make an icing.</p>


<h3>Berwick Sponge Cake</h3>

  1 even tea-spoon carbonate of soda<br />
  1 lemon
</p>

<p>Beat the eggs, yolks and whites together, with the sugar until very
light. This should take about half-an-hour. Take half of the flour and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
sift it gradually into the eggs and sugar. Mix the cream of tartar with
a gill of water, and add it to the mixture. Beat for a minute. Add the
rest of the flour and the juice and rind of the lemon. Add a little
salt. Mix well. Dissolve the carbonate of soda in four table-spoons of
hot water. Stir it carefully in. Beat again. Bake in large square or
oblong tins in a quick oven.</p>


<h3>*Gateau de Savoie</h3>

<p class="recipe">
  ¹⁄₂ <abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> powdered sugar<br />
  12 yolks of eggs<br />

  5 <abbr title="ounces">ozs.</abbr> finest flour<br />
  The grated peel of a lemon and a half
</p>

<p>Grate the lemon very finely. Mix it thoroughly with the sugar. Set it
where it will become very dry. Dry the flours and sift them.</p>

<p>Beat the yolks, the whole egg and the sugar together until very light
and creamy. This should take about half-an-hour. Then sift in the flour
and potato flour gently, and beat lightly with a whisk. Add the whites,
which should be whisked to a stiff froth. Mix lightly.</p>

<p>Butter a mould and sprinkle powdered sugar in it. Pour the mixture into
it gently. Set the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span> mould in a moderate oven, over a tin containing hot
ashes, and put a piece of greased paper over the cake. Bake for about
an hour.</p>

<h3>General Directions</h3>

<p>The tins for these cakes should be about 8 inches in diameter with a
very shallow rim. They should be kept perfectly clean, and before being
used should be slightly warmed and well greased with butter, lard or
good sweet oil.</p>

<p>Three layers are sufficient for a cake. They should not be thick.</p>

<p>Cool each layer when baked on a perfectly flat surface and spread with
the filling when cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>


<h3>Layer Cake—I</h3>

<p class="recipe">

<p>Beat the butter and sugar to a cream. Add the well beaten yolks and
then the flour, in which the baking powder has been thoroughly mixed.
Beat the whites till stiff.</p>

<p>Bake in three round shallow buttered tins in a moderate oven. When
cold, place one round on a large plate and spread it with jelly, jam
or other filling. Cover it with another round and spread this. Ice the
top. If jam is used it should be beaten or warmed a little in order
that it may spread more easily.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="General_Remarks">General Remarks</h3>
</div>

<p>In all icing that is not boiled it is necessary to use “icing” sugar,
which is very fine and flour-like in appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>


<h3>Plain Icing</h3>

<p class="recipe">
  Whites of 2 eggs<br />
  ¹⁄₂ <abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> <em>icing</em> sugar<br />
  Flavouring, lemon, vanilla, or almond, etc.
</p>

<p>Break the whites into a good sized dish. Add two heaping table-spoons
of sugar and stir it in steadily. Beat for a few minutes. Add the sugar
gradually, beating well. The making should take about half-an-hour.
When thick enough it should not run together again after being cut with
a knife. If flavoured with lemon juice, a little more sugar should be
added or the icing will not be stiff enough.</p>

<p>Pour the icing on to the cake by large spoonfuls and allow it to settle
itself as much as possible. When using a knife, dip it first in cold
water.</p>

<p>Ice a cake two or three hours before it is to be eaten. It can be set
to harden in a moderate oven for five minutes if needed quickly: but it
is best to dry it slowly in a warm, sunny place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>


<h3>Boiled Icing</h3>

<p class="recipe">
  1 cup powdered sugar<br />
  1 cup water<br />
  Whites of two eggs<br />
  Flavouring
</p>

<p>Boil the sugar and water together until it spins a thread from a spoon.
Then take the syrup off the fire and pour it into a basin. Add the
whites (beaten to a stiff froth) to it gradually, beating hard all the
time. Continue beating until the mixture is cold. Add flavouring.</p>


<h3>Gelatine Icing</h3>

<p class="recipe">
  1 tea-spoon gelatine<br />
  1 table-spoon cold water<br />
  2 table-spoons hot water<br />
  1 cup icing sugar
</p>

<p>Soak the gelatine in the cold water for half-an-hour. Add to it the hot
water and dissolve it in the same. Add it to the sugar and beat till
smooth and firm.</p>


<h3>Icing without Eggs</h3>

<p class="recipe">
  1 cup powdered sugar<br />
  5 table-spoons milk
</p>

<p>Add the milk to the sugar in a saucepan. Stir it till it boils. Then
set it where it can boil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span> gently for five minutes. Do not stir. Take
off the fire. Put into a basin. Flavour. Beat constantly until cold.</p>


<h3>Almond Icing</h3>

<p class="recipe">
  2 whites of eggs<br />
  ¹⁄₂ <abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> powdered sugar<br />
  ¹⁄₂ <abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> sweet almonds<br />
  5 bitter almonds<br />
  Rose water
</p>

<p>Blanch the almonds and let them dry. Pound them in a mortar and moisten
them with a little rose water. When perfectly smooth and fine add them
to an icing made as above (see <a href="#Page_65">p. 65</a>), of the sugar and white of egg.
Spread thickly upon the cake. Place it near a sunny window, allow it to
dry partly and cover with a coating of plain sugar icing.</p>


<h3>Chocolate Icing—I</h3>

<p class="recipe">
  1 cup sugar<br />
  1 cup water<br />
  3 <abbr title="ounces">ozs.</abbr> chocolate<br />
  1 tea-spoon vanilla
</p>

<p>Boil the sugar and water together until it forms a syrup which will
spin a thread. Add the chocolate and vanilla. Take off the fire and
beat well together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>


<h3>Chocolate Icing—II</h3>

<p>Melt two <abbr title="ounces">ozs.</abbr> of chocolate. Add it to the plain icing (see page 65).
Flavour with a few drops of vanilla.</p>


<h3>Cocoanut Icing</h3>

<p>To the plain icing (see <a href="#Page_65">p. 65</a>), made with rather less sugar than is
given, add half a cup of grated or desiccated cocoanut.</p>


<h3>Orange Icing</h3>

<p>Grate the thin outer rind of an orange. Put it in a cup. Cover it with
four tea-spoons orange juice. Let it soak for half-an-hour. Squeeze the
juice through a fine cloth. Add to the plain icing (see <a href="#Page_65">p. 65</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>


<h3>Tutti Frutti Icing</h3>

<p class="recipe">
  1 <abbr title="ounces">oz.</abbr> blanched and chopped almonds<br />
  ¹⁄₂ cup stoned and chopped raisins and sliced citron<br />
  2 whites of eggs<br />
  ¹⁄₂ <abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> icing sugar
</p>

<p>Mix the whites and the sugar as for plain icing (see <a href="#Page_65">p. 65</a>). Beat for
about twenty minutes. Work in the almonds and fruit gradually.</p>


<h3>Yellow Icing</h3>

<p class="recipe">
  2 yolks<br />
  ¹⁄₂ <abbr title="pounds">lb.</abbr> icing sugar<br />
  Flavouring
</p>

<p>Beat the yolks until frothy and light. Add the sugar very gradually,
beating hard in one direction for about half-an-hour. Flavour.</p>

little melted butter. It should be rather soft. Divide into small flat
cakes, and bake on greased tins in a slow oven. Brush over with milk
when baked.</p>

<h3>General Directions</h3>

<p>Fried cakes are best cooked in a mixture of lard and clarified
beef-dripping which has not been used before. It should be made very
hot, and be quite still. Test it by throwing in a small piece of the
mixture. If it rises at once, swells, and begins to brown on the under
side, the temperature is right for frying.</p>

<p>Doughnuts should take from 8 to 10 minutes to fry, and should be a
golden brown when finished. Directly they are ready, take them out,
allowing all the fat to drip off, and putting them on soft brown paper
to drain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

  Flour
</p>

<p>Beat the butter and sugar together until light. Beat the eggs together
and add to the butter and sugar with the cinnamon, milk and sufficient
flour to make the mixture stiff enough to roll out. Roll the mixture
out on a floured pastry board until very thin. Cut into narrow strips.
Twist or braid them. Drop them into boiling fat, boil till a golden
brown. Dust with powdered sugar while hot.</p>


<h3>Crullers</h3>

<p>Beat the butter to a cream with the sugar. Flavour with nutmeg. Add
the well beaten eggs and sufficient flour to make the mixture stiff
enough to roll out. Cut in their proper shapes and fry in a large pan
of boiling lard until a rich yellow. Keep for a day before eating.</p>

light. Add them with the rest of the sugar to the butter. Add the
salt, spices, and baking powder to the flour. Sift them and add to the

<p>Beat the eggs. Add the sugar and milk. Add flour (with which the baking
powder should be mixed) until the batter is stiff enough for the spoon

<p>Set it before the fire, covered with a cloth, to rise for two hours,
and bake in tin rings, on a slab of stone or marble, heated on the top
of an ordinary kitchen range or close stove. (This will take about two
hours to heat. The stone must be not less than one and a half inches
thick, or it is liable to crack with the heat. A discarded marble
mantel-piece is excellent for this purpose.)</p>

<p>The crumpet rings should be slightly buttered. Place them on the stone
when your batter is ready and pour into each a small tea-cupful of the
batter. As soon as the crumpet has risen, remove the ring, and turn the
crumpet over on the stone. They cook very quickly.</p>
